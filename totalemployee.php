              <p>Total Air Releases per Employee represents the facility's efficiency at generating the least amount of total releases for an individual employee. This is one of the first known projects to measure a facility's environmental impact relative to its fiscal performance by standardizing each facility's pounds of total releases with respect to the number of workers per facility. We gathered facility employee data from ReferenceUSA, Hoovers, and Orbis.</p>
