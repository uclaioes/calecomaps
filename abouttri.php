            	</div>
            <div class="panel-body">
			The main purpose of TRI is to increase public awareness of toxic chemicals and thus encourage facilities to reduce their toxic emissions. Government, NGOs, companies, and communities use TRI data to make important decisions such as developing environmental policies or investing in environmentally responsible firms. TRI data is also used to measure overall pollution trends in the United States, as well as to advocate environmental justice for communities disproportionately affected by environmental hazards.

            	</div>
            <div class="panel-body">
			In the early 1980s, chemical accidents in India and West Virginia killed thousands of people. In response, Congress passed the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) in 1986, which established the TRI program requiring certain facilities to annually report their releases of toxic chemicals.
