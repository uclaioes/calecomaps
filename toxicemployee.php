							<p>Toxic Releases per Eemployee represents the facility's efficiency at generating the least amount of toxic releases for an individual employee. This is one of the first known projects to measure a facility's environmental impact relative to its
								fiscal performance by standardizing each facility's pounds of toxic releases with respect to the number of workers per facility. We gathered facility employee data from ReferenceUSA, Hoovers, and Orbis.
