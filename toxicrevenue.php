              <p>Toxic Releases per $1000 of Revenue represents the facility's efficiency at generating the least amount of toxic releases for a standardized amount of revenue. This is the first known project to measure a facility's environmental impact relative to its fiscal performance by standardizing each facility's pounds of toxic releases with respect to $1000 of its annual revenue . We gathered facility annual revenue data from ReferenceUSA, Hoovers, and Orbis.
