        <h2>Units: Lbs</h2>
        <br>
        <br> To account for the amount of chemicals released into the environment, the Total Toxic Releases variable was selected
        to evaluate facilities because specific toxic releases can have significant environmental and public health effects,
        especially if they are released in extremely large quantities. This variable includes on- and off-site releases from
        production to air, water, land, Class I underground injection wells, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
        Subtitle C landfills, and other landfills. It excludes toxic releases due to catastrophic, one-time events so that
        toxic releases related to facility production processes are only considered.
        <br>
        <br> More information on this variable and how it was used to calculate the
        <a href="eismethodology.php" target="_blank">Cal EcoMaps Environmental Impact Score</a> can be found in our
        <a href="Report.php" target="_blank">report</a>.
