<h1>Toxicity of Total Releases</h1>
<h2>Units: lbs x toxicity</h2> <br><br>
Toxicity of Total Releases is provided by the TRI and measures the relative health-related impacts between different facilities. The facility’s total toxic releases is multiplied by a specific toxicity factor determined by the EPA’s Risk Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) for each chemical released. Only toxicity of on-site toxic releases were considered for this local analysis of health-related impacts.
