				<h1>Toxicity of Total Releases</h1>
				<h2>Units: lbs x toxicity</h2>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>Toxicity of Total Releases is provided by the TRI and measures the relative health-related impacts between different facilities. The facility’s total toxic releases is multiplied by a specific toxicity factor determined by the EPA’s Risk Screening
					Environmental Indicators (RSEI) for each chemical released. Only toxicity of on-site toxic releases were considered for this local analysis of health-related impacts.</p>

				<p>More information on this variable and how it was used to calculate the <a href="eismethodology.php" target="_blank">Cal EcoMaps Environmental Impact Score</a> can be found in our <a href="Report.php" target="_blank">report</a>.</p>
