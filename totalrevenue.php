							<p>Total Air Releases per $1000 of Revenue represents the facility's efficiency at generating the least amount of total releases for a standardized amount of revenue. This is the first known project to measure a facility's environmental impact relative
								to its fiscal performance by standardizing each facility's pounds of total releases with respect to $1000 of its annual revenue. We gathered facility annual revenue data from ReferenceUSA, Hoovers, and Orbis.</p>
